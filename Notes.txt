This ended up taking me a little longer than expected, but it was for a few
of good reasons.

First, I knew straight away that I wanted to TDD it.  This would give me
confidence in my solution, show how important quality is to me, and also give
the reader a nice little test runner that could be run straight from the file
system.  But I hadn't used QUnit in a few months, and it took me a bit of time
(probably about an hour due to some problems with scenario iteration) to 
re-orient myself.

Next, I thought that the public API on the linked website,
http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php was the thing to use. 
I thought, "cool -- they're asking if I know how to use APIs from my pages."  No
dice.  I tried a couple of little hacks, but they didn't work, leaving me with
this dilemma: do I spin up a little web server to avoid CORS problems, or do I
just fake it with regexes?  I went with the faking approach, because it keeps 
our dependencies low.  Unfortunately, I use regexes pretty rarely, especially 
for grouping, so that was a bit of a rabbit hole.  (It added maybe fifteen more
minutes.)
